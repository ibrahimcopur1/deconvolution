#File Structure 

* 'gaussian_blur.py': basic demo of creating a gaussian blur kernel and convolving with an image to apply the blur
* 'deconvolution_demo.py': in depth demo of brute force deconvolution, deconvolution on noisy images, implementation of Noise Aware Wiener filter.
Also demonstrates the trade-off between smooth edges vs grainy noise after deconvolution.
